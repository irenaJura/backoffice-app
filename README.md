# A Backoffice App To Display, Create And Delete Products

It provides users the possibility to change the products list from a panel layout to grid/tiles layout.

The dashboard displays the shop name and the products from the Swagger UI API.

Each product has a Title, Description, Price, Category, Employee.

There is a button that toggles the dashboard layout from panels to grid and vice versa.

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
